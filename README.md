## About The Project

Bamboo Loom is a Gradle plugin aimed at **revolutionizing Minecraft mod development**.
It's being designed to significantly **simplify the complexities of creating mods that support multiple mod loaders (e.g., Forge, Fabric, NeoForge, Quilt) and
various Minecraft versions** from a single, unified codebase.

The goal is to allow mod developers to:

* Focus more on creating unique mod features rather than juggling different project setups and Git Branches.
* Reduce boilerplate and repetitive tasks associated with multi-loader/multi-version development.
* Streamline the build and testing process across different environments.

## üéØ Key Goals & Planned Features (Roadmap)

The roadmap outlines the core functionalities I'm working towards. This list will be updated as development progresses.

* **üß© Core Multi-Loader/Version Support:**
  * Advanced remapping processors to handle code differences.
    * Automated run configuration generation for easy testing.
    * Predefined loader presets for quick project setup.
    * AccessWidener to AccessTransformer conversion tool.
* **üõ†Ô∏è Development Tools & Utilities:**
  * Client and Server code splitting utilities.
* **‚ú® Advanced Modding Capabilities:**
  * Interface injection for enhanced compatibility.
    * Support for Fabric Loom and (Neo)Forge Gradle Interface injections
  * Dependency injection for cleaner mod architecture.

## ü§î Why Bamboo Loom?

Developing Minecraft mods for different loaders and versions can be a time-consuming and often frustrating process. Bamboo Loom aims to be the go-to solution by
providing a powerful set of tools integrated directly into your Gradle build process, saving you time and effort.
